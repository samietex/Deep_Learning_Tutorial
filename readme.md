## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning path for individuals who are new to deep learning or looking to expand their knowledge. It covers a range of topics from basic neural network concepts to advanced techniques in an easy-to-follow format.

## Getting Started

To get started with the deep learning tutorials, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and fundamental concepts of machine learning. It's also recommended to set up a [Python environment](https://www.python.org/) with necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Repository Structure

- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step tutorials.
- `/data` - Sample datasets used in the tutorials.
- `/src` - Additional source code for custom functions, models, etc.
- `/resources` - Extra resources such as cheat sheets and reference guides.

## Tutorials

Here are some of the tutorials you'll find in this repository:

... and more. See the [Tutorials Directory](/notebooks) for the complete list.


## Datasets

The tutorials use various datasets to demonstrate different concepts. Some of the datasets include:

- MNIST Digit Recognition
- Fashion MNIST
- CIFAR-10

You can find the datasets in the `/data` folder or download them directly within the notebooks.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the tutorials, you might find the following resources helpful:
