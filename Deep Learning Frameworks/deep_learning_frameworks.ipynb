    "## Introduction to TensorFlow & Keras:\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: An open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation that makes machine learning faster and easier. It's used for a variety of tasks, but it's most famous for deep neural networks. [Learn more about TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "- **Keras**: Initially a separate neural networks library, Keras is now integrated into TensorFlow as `tf.keras`. It provides a simpler, high-level interface for building and training models. [Learn more about Keras](https://keras.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup:\n",
    "### Installation:\n",
    "- **Python**: The programming language we'll use. If you're new, download it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you select the option to Add Python to PATH during installation.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: Install it via pip, Python's package installer, by running `pip install tensorflow` in your command line. This command also automatically installs Keras as part of TensorFlow.\n",
    "- **Verification**: Ensure everything's working by typing `python` in your command line, then `import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)`. This should display the installed TensorFlow version without errors.\n",

    "For more better understanding, you can check out these resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python for Beginners by Programming with Mosh [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)\n",
    "* Python Tutorial by w3schools [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)\n",
    "* Introduction to Python Programming by Udacity [Here](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDE Setup:\n",
    "- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is where you'll write and run your code. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) is popular for data science and allows you to see results immediately. Other options include [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",
    "- You might also just want to download the Anaconda Navigator [Here](https://www.anaconda.com/). The Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) included in Anaconda Distribution. It allows data scientists to launch applications and manage conda packages, environments, and channels without using command-line commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continual Learning:\n",
    "- **Stay Updated**: Follow TensorFlow and Keras updates on their [official blog](https://blog.tensorflow.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).\n",
    "- **Community Engagement**: Join forums, attend conferences, and contribute to open source projects to stay connected with the latest in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources:\n",
    "- **TensorFlow Documentation**: For a deep dive into TensorFlow, check out the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn).\n",
    "- **Keras Documentation**: For more on Keras and its high-level capabilities, visit the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/).\n",
    "- **Online Courses and Books**: Structured learning paths can be found in online courses like Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization or books like \"Deep Learning with Python\" by Fran√ßois Chollet.\n",
